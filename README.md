## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This app addresses social media overuse through productivity tools like a Pomodoro timer, gamification via a gacha reward system, and a grayscale mode to enhance focus.

---

## CONTENTS OF PROJECT FILES'S KEY FUNCTIONS WITHIN GCI_APPApp.swift

### **Important Note**

In this project, all custom code is written exclusively within the `GCI_APPApp.swift` file. The other files and folders you see in the project directory are proprietary and automatically generated by Xcode. These system-generated files handle configuration, assets, and other resources necessary for the app but are not directly accessed or modified during development. 

All app features, such as the Pomodoro Timer, Gacha System, and grayscale mode, are fully implemented and maintained in the `GCI_APPApp.swift` file to ensure clarity and focus for the development process.

### **MainView**
- Acts as the primary hub of the application, managing navigation between the **Pomodoro Timer** and **Gacha System**.
- Uses a **TabView** for seamless transitions between features, providing an intuitive user interface.
- Integrates a **grayscale functionality** triggered when the Pomodoro Timer is active, creating a distraction-free environment for improved focus.
- Includes smooth **UI animations** for transitioning between active and inactive timer states, enhancing the user experience.

---

### **ContentView**
- Implements the core **Pomodoro Timer** functionality, allowing users to:
  - Set up and manage work and break intervals.
  - Track time remaining in a session and whether the user is in a work or break period.
  - Monitor the number of completed tasks and total points earned.
- Provides a **task setup interface**, enabling users to define session duration, task goals, and preferred Pomodoro intervals (e.g., 25-5 or 50-10).
- Features a **completion input system** to log completed tasks after each session, ensuring users receive appropriate rewards in points.

---

### **TimerSetupView**
- Offers a user-friendly interface for customizing the Pomodoro Timer:
  - **Hours and Minutes:** Allows users to select session duration using picker wheels.
  - **Task Goals:** Enables input of the total number of tasks planned for the session.
  - **Pomodoro Intervals:** Provides predefined cycles such as 25-5 or 50-10 for work and break durations.
- Features a clean and simple design using **SwiftUI Form** and **Picker** components.
- Includes intuitive navigation options with **Cancel** and **Confirm** buttons for effortless interaction.

---

### **TimerView**
- Displays a live countdown timer for active Pomodoro sessions.
- Dynamically updates the interface based on the current session state:
  - **Work Period:** Displays a black background with white text.
  - **Break Period:** Displays a white background with black text.
- Automatically transitions between work and break intervals based on the selected Pomodoro cycle.
- Alerts the user when the timer completes and transitions to the **CompletionInputView** for task verification.

---

### **CompletionInputView**
- Collects user input to log the number of completed tasks after a Pomodoro session.
- Features a **picker interface** for selecting the number of completed tasks.
- Updates the **point total** based on completed tasks, rewarding productivity and reinforcing user engagement.
- Includes an accessible design to ensure a smooth transition back to the main view after task input.

---

### **GachaScreen**
- Implements a **gamified reward system** to motivate users by converting earned points into virtual rewards.
- Features:
  - **Roll Mechanic:** Users spend points to receive randomized items like "Notebook," "Plant Pot," or "Computer," represented by different shapes and colors.
  - **Inventory Management:** Displays the user's earned items in a visually appealing grid layout.
  - **Animations:** Includes confetti effects and interactive pop-ups for successful rolls.
  - **Point Deduction:** Deducts points for each roll, maintaining fairness and consistency.
- Designed to encourage ongoing app use by linking productivity to enjoyable, gamified rewards.

---

### **Utility Functions**
- **`startTimer`**:  
  - Initializes and manages the countdown for active Pomodoro sessions.
  - Uses Swift’s **Timer** class to decrement time and transition between work and break states automatically.

- **`updatePomodoroState`**:  
  - Determines whether the user is in a work or break period based on the elapsed time and selected Pomodoro interval.
  - Ensures smooth transitions to maintain focus and motivation.

- **`resetApp`**:  
  - Resets session-related variables, such as timer length, task numbers, and session progress.
  - Prepares the app for a new session without retaining data from previous ones.

- **`rollGacha`**:  
  - Implements the logic for the Gacha System, generating random rewards based on predefined probabilities.
  - Updates the user’s inventory and triggers animations and visual effects for successful rolls.

---

## FEATURES COMPLETED
- Functional Pomodoro timer for task management.
- Fully implemented gacha system for rewarding productivity.
- Interactive inventory for managing virtual items.
- Grayscale mode to support focused usage.
